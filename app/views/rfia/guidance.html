              What kind of project or change requires an RFIA to be created?
            </label>
          </div>
            <p>An RFIA is required if a project or change has a big impact upon the business or requires many resources to complete. For example you would create an RFIA to move a large project team and it's resources from one building to another or to equip a large project team with expensive software licences.</p>
        <p>The RFIA process is not necessary for small projects or changes. For example, you wouldnt create an RFIA for one person to be issued a laptop. You may not even need an RFIA to create a small service that will be used by only a handful of staff in one building.</p>

            <li>The reason the change is required</li>
  </ul>
        <p>It's important to be as specific as possible. For example, in the requirements you will need to include the hardware and/or software licences that you know to be required and in what quantity.</p>
